# Guess What?! *(„Herz der Maschine”)*

This is a little text adventure engine, accompanied by a simple text adventure game. It was created for the [Bubblebombing Gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/bubblebombing-gamejam-die-1). As required by the jam’s organizers, the game is German only.

Due to the limited time frame of the gamejam, the engine is very basic and the game is very short. There will still be bugs and missing features, as well as some hard-coded strings that should instead be in a language file. But the story itself is defined in a custom YAML-like format, which is quite easy to understand and extend.

The engine supports moving through different locations (rooms), picking up and using items, and talking to NPCs.
